    "The provided solution works for identifying the first duplicate value in a binary tree that is closest to the root because it systematically explores the tree using depth-first search (DFS) while keeping track of seen values. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TreeNode Class: Defines the structure of each node in the binary tree, including its value (val) and pointers to its left and right children.\n",
    "\n",
    "- is_duplicate Function: This is the main function that initiates the process. It checks if the root is None (i.e., the tree is empty) and returns -1 in that case, indicating no duplicates. If the tree is not empty, it calls the dfs function, passing the root node and an empty set (seen_values) to track the values seen so far during the traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- dfs Function: This recursive function performs depth-first search on the binary tree. It takes a node and the set of seen values as arguments. The base case for the recursion is when the node is None, at which point it returns -1, indicating no duplicate found in the current path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duplicate Check: For each node visited, the function checks if the node's value is already in the seen_values set. If it is, this means a duplicate has been found, and the function immediately returns the duplicate value. This ensures that the first duplicate encountered (closest to the root due to DFS) is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursion for Left and Right Subtrees: If the current node's value is not a duplicate, it is added to the seen_values set, and the function recursively explores the left subtree. If the left subtree call returns a value other than -1, it means a duplicate was found in the left subtree, and this value is returned immediately without checking the right subtree. This prioritizes duplicates closer to the root on the left side. If no duplicate is found in the left subtree, the function then recursively explores the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returning the Result: The function returns the first duplicate value found (if any). If no duplicates are found in the entire tree, the function returns -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution effectively finds the first duplicate value in a binary tree by leveraging the depth-first search strategy, ensuring that the search prioritizes nodes closer to the root and efficiently tracks seen values to identify duplicates."

Initially, the problem statement seemed daunting; however, reviewing the class recordings, and breaking it down into smaller step by step solutions, made it into manageable tasks and made the whole process more approachable.

The iterative process of writing, testing, and refining the code for the assignment was a tedious but rewarding, as each iteration brought me closer to a more efficient and elegant solution.\n",
